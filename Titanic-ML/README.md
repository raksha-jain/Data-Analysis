# TITANIC DATASET
## 1.1 Description
### The Titanic Dataset: Dataset containing passengers details.

### Content

The question is What sort of people were more likely to survive?<br>
Using machine learning we create a predictive model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class etc.)<br>
<p>The data has been split into two
<p>1. Training data<br>
  2. Test data
<p> The training data is used to build machine learning model, for training data the ground truth is provided for each passenger. In test data its our job to predict the outcome ie the ground truth.
