### 2. Description
 <p> The data has been split into two
<p> 1. Training data<br>
   2. Test data
<p>  The training data is used to build machine learning model, for training data the ground truth is provided for each passenger. In test data its our job to predict the outcome ie the ground truth.

<p> The following data is included<br>
 1.  PassengerId: Unique id number to each passenger<br>
