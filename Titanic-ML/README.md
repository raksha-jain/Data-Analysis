# TITANIC DATASET
### 1. Description
<p> The Titanic Dataset contains passengers details.<br>
 <p> The data has been split into two
<p> 1. Training data<br>
   2. Test data
<p>  The training data is used to build machine learning model, for training data the ground truth is provided for each passenger. In test data its our job to predict the outcome ie the ground truth.

<p> The following data is included<br>
 1.  PassengerId: Unique id number to each passenger<br>
 2.  Survived: Passenger survived(1) or died(0)<br>
 3.  Pclass: Passenger class<br>
 4.  Name: Name<br>
 5.  Sex: Gender of passenger<br>
 6.  Age: Age of passenger<br>
 7.  SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses<br>
 8.  Parch: Number of parents/children<br>
 9.  Ticket: Ticket number<br>
 10.  Fare: Amount of money spent on ticket<br>
 11.  Cabin: Cabin category<br>
 12.  Embarked: Port where passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)<br>

### 2. Question
<p>  What sort of people are more likely to survive?.<br>

Using machine learning we create a predictive model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class etc.)<br>
